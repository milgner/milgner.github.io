<meta name="description" content="Here&rsquo;s a short excerpt from my past and current (public) projects:

SR6 Character Sheet: when our gaming group switched to online play during the COVID-19 pandemic, I built a digital character sheet for Shadowrun 6
Keedrop: easily &amp; securely send passwords. It doesn&rsquo;t replace GPG, but at least you won&rsquo;t have to send them in plaintext over chat or email.
k290-fnkeyctl: when I got myself annoyed with the way that my Logitech keyboard handled its function keys, I reverse-engineered a small application to switch the behaviour on Linux.
SQLite3-WinRT, metro-driver and Win8-Cucumber.js: working at doo (nowadays called Scanbot), we pioneered development on the then new Windows 8 platform and wrote a SQLite3 adapter as well as tooling for automated testing of our application.
Compoker is a small complexity poker app which was my first project written in Rust. It was only meant to teach me a bit of Rust and learn some Svelte along the way. It&rsquo;s probably going to remain a bit of a Rust learning playground for me.
ActiveActivity is my most recent project. When working in a Rails project at work, I noticed that there&rsquo;s no built-in facility to orchestrate continuously-running activities in Rails - so I built it. Still in alpha stage.
