  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some time has passed after my last post and despite my solemn vow to blog more,
that didn&rsquo;t happen. That&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve been a busy bee and, again, too
preoccupied with other stuff to write anything meaningful.
The search for a new interesting job was &ndash; luckily &ndash; very short and left me in
the company of the great guys at <a href="http://evopark.de">evopark</a>. There I&rsquo;m now
responsible for the architecture, implementation and related sys-ops of their
IT infrastructure. It&rsquo;s loads of fun and I can finally work with Ruby On Rails
full-time again.</p>

<p>And if there&rsquo;s one thing to take away from the last couple of weeks, it&rsquo;s that
the development process with Rails has become even more awesome since its
initial inception.<br/>
The surrounding ecosystem is huge, there are loads of stable, well-tested and
documented gems to quickly develop complex, yet maintainable applications.</p>

<p>But there&rsquo;s one subject that&rsquo;s still&hellip; suboptimal: creating PDF reports.
There are a couple of approaches that can roughly be divided into two categories:
<a href="http://wkhtmltopdf.org/">wkhtmltopdf</a> and <a href="https://github.com/prawnpdf/prawn">Prawn</a>.
Yet, when compared to mature reporting solutions from the Java world, like
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/birt/about/">BIRT</a> and <a href="http://community.jaspersoft.com/project/jasperreports-library">JasperReports</a>
they all seem woefully inadequate.</p>

you, its learning curve is as steep as the framework is awesome. And its awesome

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For a few months now I have been wondering about occasional hickups in my
<a href="https://www.gitlab.com/gitlab-ce/">Gitlab</a> setup. I run both Gitlab and
<a href="https://www.gitlab.com/gitlab-ci/">Gitlab CI</a> on my server, along with a number
of other Rails-based applications.</p>

<p>Since I could mostly relate these to the creation of new repository, which is
something I don&rsquo;t do that often, I didn&rsquo;t care that much about it.</p>

<p>But then today it happened again and, having some time on my hands, I decided to
finally investigate. As it turns out, it was a problem with both Gitlab and its
CI using the (wonderful) <a href="http://sidekiq.org/">Sidekiq</a> gem for asynchronous job
execution. And both instances tried to use the same <a href="http://redis.io">Redis</a>
instance, getting hopelessly tangled in the process.</p>

<p>Luckily, this kind of situation can be easily solved with a custom initializer.
Just create a new file, <code>config/initializers/sidekiq.rb</code> in each project, with
the following content:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>config/initializers/sidekiq.rb</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>Technically speaking, the namespace is not required but I think it&rsquo;s a good idea
nonetheless.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This week my employer, Bonn-based <a href="http://doo.net">startup doo</a> announced that
they must discontinue the development of our planned product and had to let go
of all associated teams.</p>

<p>Given the dynamics of the IT startup world, it wasn&rsquo;t that much of a shock.
There are different numbers for success rates out there but even the best ones
don&rsquo;t exceed 30% probability.</p>

<p>What surprised me much more was that apparently there is not enough demand in
the market for the product we were trying to build: an end-to-end encrypted,
distributed file storage and collaboration tool.
At the point of writing, there is only one competitor that I do consider to be
on-par with my expectations of security/cryptography: <a href="https://tresorit.com/">Tresorit</a>.
But even they, although they have a product with very high security standards
and a good (though not outstanding) user experience, don&rsquo;t seem to be able to
get the required traction. People don&rsquo;t seem to care about their data.</p>

<p>One year after Edward Snowden publicized the massive intrusions of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes">Five Eyes</a>
states into our personal lives &ndash; and also their close cooperation with other
intelligence services like the german <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundesnachrichtendienst">Bundesnachrichtendienst</a> &ndash;
everything is the same as it was before. True, a few nerds may have cancelled
their Facebook account or installed GPG, but still we have been unable to
communicate the situation to the vast majority of the population.
So: more crypto, please. We need better IT products.</p>

<p>Having said that, I&rsquo;m now free to look for new challenges and opportunities on
which to hack on. Luckily, skilled developers are in high demand and my broad
range of experiences makes me versatile enough that it shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem to
find interesting projects, so I&rsquo;m much more excited about what&rsquo;s to come than
worried about unemployment. <i class='emoji wink'></i></p>

<p>During the coming month, besides writing job applications, I hope to work on
some open source software projects, make a lot of music and also find time and
inspiration for some more blogging.
One thing I&rsquo;ve been contemplating was to write a series of posts entitled &ldquo;The
Big Continuous Integration Shootout&rdquo; wherein I present a number of CI systems,
their strengths and weaknesses and where they are best employed. If you have any
comments on that, please <a href="mailto:mail@marcusilgner.com">drop me a line</a>!</p>

<time datetime="2014-03-02T11:37:00+01:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Mar 2<span>nd</span>, 2014</time>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>In my quest for more storytelling-oriented role playing systems and more exotic
settings, I recently came across <a href="http://www.numenera.com">Numenera</a>, a game by
RPG-veteran Monte Cook, whom you may know from games like D&amp;D or Call of Cthulhu.</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t go into a full review of the game here. If you are interested, you may
find one on <a href="http://www.livingdice.com/8327/review-numenera-the-role-playing-game-from-monte-cook/">LivingDice</a>
or as a video by the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxz6tRPIZGs">Gentleman Gamer on YouTube</a>.</p>

<p>The setting of Numenera allows for a number of strange and powerful character foci,
which work a bit like classes in other rule settings. Here I&rsquo;m going to present
to you a new focus I came up with while becoming familiar with the material.
I&rsquo;m not yet sure whether the balancing is ok, but in the face of fire-wielding and
mind-reading characters I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s as over-powered as it may seem in other
contexts.</p>

<h2>Controls Chance</h2>

<p>Where others only see random occurrences, you observe the underlying patterns.
Others may think you just lucky but what they don&rsquo;t know is what you can achieve
with only little nudges to the fabric of the world.
Sometimes it&rsquo;s just unconscious, like stepping aside just before a projectile would
have hit you, and sometimes you are fully aware of what you are doing.
A possible explanation is that the numenera all around you feed you information
that your subconscious interprets; but no matter what the cause, you know how
the dice are going to fall.
You need to be in the vicinity of the events happening and they must be happening
right this moment: Drawing the right card from a deck is easy but knowing which
numbers will be picked in the lottery next week? Not so much.</p>

<p><strong>Connection:</strong> Pick one other PC. For some reason your powers don&rsquo;t predict anything
she does. It&rsquo;s quite distracting and you may decide whether you fear her or want
to solve the enigma.</p>

<p><strong>Additional equipment:</strong> A deck of beautifully crafted cards and a set of dice.
You learn so much from experimenting in small scale.</p>

<p><strong>Minor effect suggestion:</strong> Your luck surprises your target, leaving them distracted
for their next action which becomes one step harder for them.</p>

<p><strong>Major effect suggestion:</strong> You are prepared for this to happen and can immediately
take a second action during this turn.</p>

<p><strong>Tier 1: Understanding Randomness.</strong> You know the likelihood of everything occurring.
Whether it&rsquo;s winning at Blackjack, a weapon misfiring or the chance for rain, you
know how likely it is to happen, down to the last decimal. Enabler.</p>

<p><strong>Tier 2: Influence Chance (1+ Intellect points).</strong> You finally have not only understood
chance but even managed to open a back-channel. No one&rsquo;s gonna beat you at dice.
For every Intellect point you invest, you can improve the odds for something to
happen by 50% of its original potentiality. Action.</p>

<blockquote><p>Example: a perfect coin toss usually has a chance of 50% to come up heads.
Spending one point increases it to 75%, another point to 100%. On the other hand,
the chance for the opposing mercenaries gun to misfire may be 1%, so increasing
it to 1.5% is still unlikely to save your hide.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Tier 3: Uncanny luck.</strong> Your understanding of your surroundings has become subconscious.
For the suprise attack rules, the character is always considered to be on guard.
In addition, you can reroll your Speed Defense rolls and take the better result.
Enabler.</p>

<p><strong>Tier 4: Lucky Coin (4 Intellect points).</strong> You can extend your power towards another
player, usually by giving him a lucky coin or other small token. For the next hour,
this player has the same advantages as from your <em>Uncanny Luck</em>. Applying an effort
extends it to 24 hours. Action.</p>

<p><strong>Tier 5: Zen Centering.</strong> You have finally mastered your understanding of the world
around you and completely internalized it. You always pick the right ledges when
climbing, time your attacks better and know where to set your feet to reduce the
chance of a mishap. Your Speed Edge and Effort score increase by 1 and your
Intellect pool is improved by 5. Enabler.</p>

<p><strong>Tier 6: Nothing left to chance (1+ Intellect points).</strong> Your understanding of your
surroundings has also made manipulation a lot easier and even quantum flux feels
predictable to you.
For every intellect point you spend, increase the chance for something to happen
by 10%. Action.</p>

<blockquote><p>Note: The initial chance can be really small but it must be plausible. It&rsquo;s not
realistic that suddenly a piano will fall on an opponent from the sky. But that
doesn&rsquo;t mean that some of the artifacts he&rsquo;s carrying won&rsquo;t suddenly go haywire
or that his sword &ndash; despite being forged my a master craftsman &ndash; breaks.</p></blockquote>

<time datetime="2014-01-24T22:06:00+01:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jan 24<span>th</span>, 2014</time>
        
      </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: If you have a Logitech K290 and want your F-keys to work regularly on Linux,
<a href="https://github.com/milgner/k290-fnkeyctl">you can now</a>.</p>

<hr />

<p>A few weeks ago I got myself a <a href="www.logitech.com/product/comfort-keyboard-k290">Logitech K290</a> keyboard for my home
office. I really like how silent it is and the attack on the keys feels very nice, too. Also it is quite resistant
to crumbs, which were somehow always squeezing through the gaps of my former Cherry XStream.</p>

<p>But despite this, the keyboard has a major flaw: by default, the function keys work as a kind of &ldquo;multimedia&rdquo; keys
instead of good ol&#8217; <code>F1</code> through <code>F12</code>. On Windows that can easily be remedied by installing the Logitech Setpoint
software. But on Linux, where I do most of my hacking, it is a major PITA to always need to use the <code>Fn</code> modifier.</p>

<p>At first, I thought I&rsquo;d just have to roll with it or begin <em>The Chase For A Comfortable Keyboard</em> anew but after
accidentally shutting down my machine yesterday &ndash; when all I wanted to was to press F12, forgetting the modifier &ndash;,
I was overcome by a sudden Nerd Rage: this device obviously needed some serious hacking.</p>

<p>Equipped with cursory knowledge about the USB protocol and my usual can-do-attitude, I fired up the browser,
looking for a way to snoop on the USB traffic. After two unsuccessful tries, I came across <a href="http://desowin.org/usbpcap/">USBPcap</a>,
which can be used in conjunction with <a href="http://wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a> to do USB protocol analysis.</p>

<p>After a few tries it became quickly apparent that toggling the checkbox in the Windows software would send one specific
control packet to the device, so I decided to write a small tool to do exactly this on Linux.</p>

<p>At first it did not work, because I used the simplified <code>libusb_open_device_with_vid_pid</code> function from libusb which
has no proper error reporting. So I added proper device enumeration and found that the error was <code>LIBUSB_ERROR_ACCESS</code>.
And behold: running it via <code>sudo</code> made everything work on the first try!</p>

<p>So this concludes a wonderfully entertaining friday night. :D</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h4>(A late New Years post)</h4>

<p>Well, not really <strong>for</strong> ignorance, but for being able to recognize and admit to it. I was recently reminded of that fact after finishing <a href="https://class.coursera.org/humankind-001/">A Brief History Of Humankind</a> at Coursera. While explaining the evolution of our race, Dr. Harari often mentioned how many things in our lives are just intellectual constructs: countries, companies, religions and of course our financial and other social systems. After going through humankinds early history, When reaching modern times, he explains how admitting our ignorance and discovering science could lead to all the advances in the past few hundred years.</p>

<p>Before, humanity was unable to grasp all the unknown unknowns all around them. Everyone believed in a god-given order and accepted how everything worked. Then some people decided they wanted to know why things work the way they do, create theories and verify hypotheses. But they could only do that by first admitting that they didn&rsquo;t know how things worked. And during the scientific process, one will always be wrong more often than one right.</p>

<p>That is also applicable to everyday life. In recent years, I have grown more and more annoyed at how society shapes an inability to admit flaws and errors. The old saying <em>Errare Humanum Est</em><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> seems to have disappeared from our collective minds along with its latin roots. Whether it is politicians or CEOs, to admit to past errors has become unconceivable; everyone wants to set themselves up as a larger-than-life icon, a photoshopped character on the frontpage of a magazine. And here is where we come to the second part of that formerly mentioned phrase: <em>perseverare autem diabolicum, et tertia non datur</em><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>. If no one is able to admit their mistakes, they won&rsquo;t be rectified and nothing will improve.</p>

<p>I just hope that instead of trying to loose a few pounds, in 2014 more people will start admitting to their flaws and facilitate the same for others by accepting theirs. Here&rsquo;s to making many mistakes and learning from them! Cheers!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This weeks post has to do with the course <a href="https://iversity.org/c/6?r=5ced0">&ldquo;The Future of Storytelling&rdquo;</a>
which recently started on the new platform <a href="https://iversity.org?r=5ced0">Iversity</a>.</p>

<p>I have been interested in this subject for some time now, especially in
collaborative storytelling in role-playing games, so when this course came along,
I knew I couldn&rsquo;t miss it.</p>

<p>What makes this course a bit different from the other courses I took in the past,
is that it seems to involve actual writing and storytelling. At the end of each
week (a &ldquo;chapter&rdquo;) the students are given a task which to accomplish.</p>

<p>The task for this week, to be executed in this very blog post for your reading pleasure:</p>

<blockquote><p>Please think about which story you have read, seen, listened to, played or experienced has impressed you most in your life. … Which story can you still very well remember? Write down both, the summary of this story (what you remember of the story, not what Wikipedia says.. :) and – on the other hand: – what made it so special to you that you can still remember it.</p></blockquote>

<p>So here is the story how <em>Star Wars</em> changed my life:</p>

<h3>The Hero&rsquo;s Journey</h3>

<p>A regular summary of the <em>Star Wars</em> story is probably quite uninteresting for
everyone who hasn&rsquo;t been living under a rock the last 30 years. From a storytelling
point of view, it is quite unremarkable, even: a science-fiction-themed fairytale
describing the classical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomyth">&ldquo;hero&rsquo;s journey&rdquo;</a>
as described by Joseph Campbell in &ldquo;The Hero with a Thousand Faces&rdquo;.
I use the term &ldquo;fairytale&rdquo; because it has many resemblances to traditional folk
tales: from the way it starts off with the sentence &ldquo;A long time ago&hellip;&rdquo; to the
distinctive way that characters are painted good or evil and employing easily-
recognizable archetypes.</p>

<h4>Yodas wisdom</h4>

<p>I don&rsquo;t remember exactly how old I was when I watched the first <em>Star Wars</em> movies,
but I guess I must have been around 10 years.
The scene that would have such a lasting effect on my life is from the beginning
of &ldquo;The Empire Strikes Back&rdquo;, the second movie of the <em>Star Wars</em> trilogy.
The alien Yoda, portraied to possess unassailable wisdom, is mentoring Luke, the
protagonist and training him to use the <em>Force</em>.
When Luke struggles with a particular mental excercise, Yoda utters this quote:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Fear is the path to the dark side: Fear leads to anger, Anger leads to hate, Hate leads to Suffering&rdquo;.</p></blockquote>

<p>I could not help but ponder this quote, comparing it to my own observations and
found much merit in it.
My 9th birthday, 17th January 1991 had coincided with the starting date of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Desert_Storm">Operation Desert Storm</a>.
My parents television was running and I still remember the pictures of war, slowly
coming to a first understanding of the situation in the world and wondering how
it could have come this. Why people were building were expending all this energy
to build high-tech jets and other weaponry just to kill each other.</p>

<h4>Becoming a <del>Jedi</del> Zen Master</h4>

<p>The <em>Star Wars</em> movie awakened in me the notion that people are driven to this
behaviour via these emotions, fear and anger, followed by hate.
The story also told how engaging in evil acts &ndash; those associated with the <em>Dark
Side</em> &ndash; would have a poisonous effect on someones character, leading them down a
road towards more and more evil.
And since it was clear to my young and impressionable mind that I didn&rsquo;t want to
be evil, I concluded that I would ever need to be wary of these emotions, fear,
anger and hate and where they could lead me.
In this aspect, <em>Star Wars</em> fulfilled another aspect rooted in the origins of
storytelling: providing examples for socially desirable behaviour, worthy of imitation.</p>

<p>Understand that I didn&rsquo;t want to become a <em>Jedi Knight</em> or somesuch thing: I fully
realized the fictional aspect of what I had seen. Nonetheless, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t fall to the
<em>Dark Side</em>&rdquo; became some kind of a motto for me.
And I can say that I have successfully managed to adhere to my old tenets until
today. So much even, that a few years back a friend of mine jokingly called me
&ldquo;Zen Master Marcus&rdquo;. It was just a stray remark but I still find it hilarious.</p>

<p>And surely enough: to this day I have read enough books and listened to enough
Psychology lectures to have garnered a much more differentiated understanding of
emotions and the way to the &ldquo;<em>Dark Side</em>&rdquo;.
But I also have experienced people acting cruel and callous. Both in reaction to
being hurt and out of desire for power and control over others when they themselves
seemed to lack control of their own lifes.
This makes me think that the simple Yoda version works well enough as an
approximation to the truths behind the self-perpetuating suffering. And it&rsquo;s
certainly easier than trying to explain social psychology studies to a ten-year-old.</p>

<h4>Bonus part</h4>

<p>So much for the #StoryMOOC task. But funnily enough there is a second aspect on
how <em>Star Wars</em> influenced my life. It probably could have been any other movie,
too, so this is kind of a bonus scene in this blog post.</p>

<p>At the age of 13 or 14 years I started having occasional nightmares. Therein I
was chased by evil characters who wanted to shoot me. After a few repetitions &ndash;
each one some time apart: this is not that kind of story where the young boy is
haunted by nightmares every night &ndash; the pursuers turned from gangsters shooting
at me into the droids C-3PO and R2-D2 from the <em>Star Wars</em> movie.
Ok, now I should probably give you some time to stop laughing. Awake, I found the
notion quite ridiculous myself: the meanest thing C-3PO would have been able to
do was to call you a <em>buffoon</em> in 6 million forms of communication.
Sure, R2-D2 could probably use his 1337 hacking skillz to crack your social media
profiles and post &ldquo;My mother can&rsquo;t cook.&rdquo; to your wall, but back then there wasn&rsquo;t
even an internet.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, these two robots were in my dreams, chasing me through the village
and into my room upstairs. How R2-D2 managed to climb the stairs in my parents&#8217;
house, I&rsquo;ll never know.
But the same dream continued to occur. And since it was always the same dream,
after a few months I started to recognize it as such. And once I figured out I
was in a dream, I decided that I should just jump out of the window: to die and
thus wake from the dream.
The first time I did this I was more scared of trying this than from the actual
nightmare. But it worked and I could wake, turn around in my bed and fall peacefully
asleep again.
The second time &ndash; or maybe third, I don&rsquo;t exactly remember &ndash; I grew more adventurous.
Since it was a dream, I decided, I didn&rsquo;t need to die but I could as well fly away
from the two figures who, even though relentless as robots, were quite slow and could
never catch me. And once again it worked. Unbeknown to my younger self, I had taken
my first steps &ndash; or flight &ndash; in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_dream">Lucid dreaming</a>.
All combined, I can say without doubt that <em>Star Wars</em> spiked both my desire in mastering
my emotions and realizing that, with some training, I could master my consciousness
enough to even control my dreams.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Now for a short break. Or make that a wish for more breaks. Time has been
especially short for me for the last few weeks. I even had to cancel my vacation
&ndash; just when I was looking forward to catching up on my MOOCs.</p>

<p>But all crunchtime must come to an end and there really are some interesting
courses to look forward to, too.</p>

<p>Although I&rsquo;m hopelessly behind schedule on &ldquo;Think Again&rdquo;, I&rsquo;ll also pick up
that one again. I must admit that week 3 found me  in a kind of unmotivated mood
as the course was progressing quite slowly and the application of the subject
matter eluded me.
The topic for week 4 is Propositional Logic and Truth Tables: quite familiar
ground for people with an IT background, so I&rsquo;ll probably be able to breeze
through that part.
After that the topic seems to become more complex and I also feel like I can see
an arch emerging that goes from analyzing arguments to developing ones own
arguments.
But even if I&rsquo;ll probably not be able to apply the topic at hand in the way I
originally presumed, I guess I still may find it highly useful for my personal
contemplations.</p>

<p>And as if my list of interesting MOOCs wasn&rsquo;t long enough already, a new MOOC
portal, <a href="https://iversity.org">Iversity</a> opened its doors just today.
Among the initial course lineup there&rsquo;s one I find especially interesting:
<a href="https://iversity.org/c/6?r=5ced0">The Future Of Storytelling</a>.
Ever since first playing a round of the <a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/games/fiasco/">Fiasco roleplaying game</a>
a couple of months ago, I found myself more and more intrigued with the topic of
Storytelling.
I also watched the first week of <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/onlinegames">Online Games: Literature, New Media, and Narrative</a> on Coursera, but somehow couldn&rsquo;t really warm to it.
So I&rsquo;m really looking forward to this course on Iversity.
The hashtag is #storymooc &ndash; see you there!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I started <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/thinkagain">Think Again: How to Reason and Argue</a>
with a mix of curiosity and genuine interest. In the past, I have often come across
bad reasoning and although I learned to identify some items from the <a href="http://www.nizkor.org/features/fallacies/index.html">long list of fallacies</a>,
I am not confident that I can formulate my own arguments in a well-structured way
when in spontaneous situations.</p>

<p>Also, I&rsquo;m currently reading <a href="http://www.amazon.de/Thinking-Fast-and-Slow-ebook/dp/B00555X8OA?tag=aflattrcom997-21">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a>
and I felt like attending &ldquo;Think Again&rdquo; might work well in conjuction, even though
they are about different subjects: the latter is about psychology in general while
this course is about arguments and reasoning.</p>

<p>However, after just finishing the video lectures and excercises for the second week,
I&rsquo;m positively surprised by how well-made and entertaining it is.</p>
