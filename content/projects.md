Here's a short excerpt from my past and current (public) projects:

- [Keedrop](https://keedrop.de): easily & securely send passwords. It doesn't replace GPG, but at least you won't have to send them in plaintext over chat or email.
- [k290-fnkeyctl](https://github.com/milgner/k290-fnkeyctl): when I got myself annoyed with the way that my Logitech keyboard handled its function keys, I reverse-engineered a small application to switch the behaviour on Linux.
- [SQLite3-WinRT](https://github.com/doo/SQLite3-WinRT), [metro-driver](https://github.com/doo/metro-driver) and [Win8-Cucumber.js](https://github.com/milgner/Win8-Cucumber.js): working at doo (nowadays called [Scanbot](scanbot.io)), we pioneered development on the then new Windows 8 platform and wrote a SQLite3 adapter as well as tooling for automated testing of our application.
