So here's my new website :tada: And I have plans to start blogging
more about IT & software development topics again.
My days at [evopark](https://www.evopark.de) are coming to an end
and in December I'll start my new job at 
[i22 Digitalagentur](https://www.i22.de/) in Bonn.

Since I'll have some free time on my hands until then - I decided that
I should take some time to clear my head instead of jumping head first
from one job into the next - I thought that I should use this time of
new beginnings and also update my blog and finally write down some of
the things that have been going through my mind in the last couple of
months.

There's already a number of topics that I'm looking forward to write
about: from a series titled "Advanced Ruby on Rails" - with everything
from making your database work for you to dependency injection in Ruby
- to less technical articles (Stop calling it "Soft Skills"!), I'm sure
that my keyboard(s) will have to endure quite a bit of wear soon :wink:

Hope to hearing from you! :wave:
