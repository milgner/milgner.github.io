Born 1982, I spent my teenage years witnessing and exploring the rise of the
internet. Since, I have been able to gather professional experience in a
number of technologies: everything from network security and setting up
Sendmail-based mail servers :incoming_envelope:, doing computer games
development in C++ and DirectX :video_game:, via Java business software
:briefcase: up to web applications with Ruby On Rails :gem: and real-time data processing applications with Vert.x :airplane:.

When I'm not sitting in front of a computer screen, trying out new technology,
you might find me hiking along the Rhine, the alps or other terrain
:mount_fuji:. Or maybe I'm meeting with friends for a night of boardgaming or
pen&paper roleplaying :game_die:.
Also I like playing various stringed instruments :guitar:, but
unfortunately this hobby had to take a back seat the last couple of years.
