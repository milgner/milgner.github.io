      <description>A bit of git (each day) - Part 1: Basics    Since its inception in 2005, git has quickly established itself as the de-facto standard for version control in software development.
Yet I find that surprisingly many developers struggle with using it to its full potential even after many years of having been in contact with it. There is an excellent book &amp;ldquo;Pro Git&amp;rdquo; available online but for some reason not many people are familiar with its contents or are lacking some focussed exposure to the many aspects therein.</description>
