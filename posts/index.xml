      <description>Wikis aren&amp;rsquo;t meant for software documentation     &amp;ldquo;Documentation is a love letter that you write to your future self.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Damian Conway Although there are many arguments being made to rationalize our laziness and avoid writing proper documentation, there is no doubt in my mind that good software documentation is a great tool to improve the development lifecycle of long-running projects.
If you know your project is going to be scrapped in 2 months time, feel free to stop reading here and enjoy a good book or a walk outside.</description>

      <description>Deploy a Vert.x application with an embedded SPA    As a developer I have come to enjoy the versatility and power of the Vert.x platform. And although it contains many utilities for server-side rendering, called Vert.x Web, there are situations where you might want to use a single-page application (SPA) instead.
Concrete reasons for and against SPAs are best kept separate from this. One thing, however, that makes SPAs cumbersome for small teams is having to deploy them separately from the API they will talk to, so having a setup that allows for deploying everything in one go.</description>
