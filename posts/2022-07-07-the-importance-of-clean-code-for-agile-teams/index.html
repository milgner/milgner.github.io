Most everyone who works in software development will know the situation
where you have written some code that manages to somehow solve a current
problem - but when looking at it the next day (or showing it to another
person), it turns out that there are a couple of design issues with it.
Now the question automatically arises: should we merge it or give it a
bit of love and clean it up?">

<p>Most everyone who works in software development will know the situation
where you have written some code that manages to somehow solve a current
problem - but when looking at it the next day (or showing it to another
person), it turns out that there are a couple of design issues with it.</p>
<p>Now the question automatically arises: should we merge it or give it a
bit of love and clean it up?</p>
<p>Personally I&rsquo;m in the latter camp. This is not only driven by an aesthetics-
driven claim to high-quality code, but is also informed by business and the
requirements of an agile environment.</p>
<h2 id="requirements-change-well-crafted-code-can-change">
  Requirements change; well-crafted code can change
  <a class="heading-link" href="#requirements-change-well-crafted-code-can-change">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h2>
<p>In agile software development, we have learned to acknowledge the fact that
requirements change. And if it were possible to anticipate these changes,
then probably they&rsquo;d be there already. So, do yourselves a favour and
<a href="https://medium.com/swlh/stop-predicting-the-future-of-your-code-e0d403116f90"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stop predecting the future of your code</a>.
If it were possible to build workable abstractions that will last the
lifetime of the application at the start of the project&hellip; well, it&rsquo;s
possible there wouldn&rsquo;t have been a cause to write the Manifesto for Agile
Software Development in the first place.</p>
<p>TIL that Robert C. Martin apparently proposed to add a fifth value to it: <a href="https://medium.com/tacta/software-craftmanship-writing-code-for-the-future-a2caf87312e5"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&ldquo;Craftsmanship over Execution&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>It is my interpretation that this is because well-crafted code constitutes a
collection of composable pieces that enable you to react to changes. You can
easily re-arrange and adapt them to suit new requirements and build new features
upon them - thereby allowing you to speed up development as time goes on.</p>
<p>The fastest execution is only worth so much if it leads to a mountain of
technical debt, slows you down and makes you think of spaghetti every time
you open a file in your code base.</p>
<h2 id="maybe-an-issue-with-oop">
  Maybe an issue with OOP?
  <a class="heading-link" href="#maybe-an-issue-with-oop">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h2>
<p>It is my hypothesis, that a large part of this problem is due to the
built-in <a href="https://medium.com/codemonday/banana-gorilla-jungle-oop-5052b2e4d588"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gorilla-Banana-problem</a>
of object-oriented programming languages. But unfortunately I don&rsquo;t have
enough experience working with larger production-grade applications written
in a functional style to confirm this suspicion.</p>
<h2 id="its-a-process">
  It&rsquo;s a process
  <a class="heading-link" href="#its-a-process">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h2>
<p>The craft of software development is a complex one and there never comes a
point where one wakes up one morning and suddenly finds that they know all
there is to know about it.</p>
<p>That is why the <a href="http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Manifesto for Software Craftsmanship</a>,
picking up on the Agile Manifesto and extrapolating on it,
mentions the <em>community of professionals</em>: software development is such
a broad topic, that everyone has something to learn and we should strive to,
continuously, both teach and to learn from another.</p>
<p>So, let&rsquo;s everyone do their best and <a href="https://medium.com/@learnstuff.io/broken-window-theory-in-software-development-bef627a1ce99"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">avoid breaking windows</a>
during stressful phases.</p>
