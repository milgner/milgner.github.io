  </a>
</h1>
<p>Since its inception in 2005, <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a> has quickly
established itself as the de-facto standard for version control in software
development.</p>
<p>Yet I find that surprisingly many developers struggle with using it to its
full potential even after many years of having been in contact with it.
There is an excellent <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/">book &ldquo;Pro Git&rdquo;</a>
available online but for some reason not many people are familiar with its
contents or are lacking some focussed exposure to the many aspects therein.</p>
<p>This series is my personal endeavour to rectify this by providing a number
of short articles to explain both concepts behind git as well as practical
tips, so that by spending just a few minutes each day, you&rsquo;ll soon have all
the knowledge you need to competently employ git in your daily work.</p>
<p>To be on the safe side, I won&rsquo;t assume any prior knowledge and start with a
few basics. If you already had practical exposure to git, you&rsquo;ll probably know
most if not all of this. In that case, feel free to skip ahead and come back
tomorrow to read about another aspect of working with git: branching
and branching strategies.</p>
<h2 id="whats-a-distributed-version-control-system">
  What&rsquo;s a (distributed) version control system?
  <a class="heading-link" href="#whats-a-distributed-version-control-system">
    <i class="fa fa-link" aria-hidden="true"></i>
  </a>
</h2>
<p>Git is a distributed version control system. Essentially, a version control
system is a piece of software that helps you to keep track of changes to one
or more files and, when working in a team, coordinate the changes made by the
members of that team so they can change version-controlled files without
accidentally overriding or deleting someone elses work.</p>
<p><em>Distributed</em> means that the whole set of information about these tracked
files and changes therein - the <em>repository</em> - is not only kept in one
central place but can be distributed among many places. That usually means
locally on the computers of the people working with it - i.e. you - as well
as a number of servers, called <em>remotes</em>. Indeed, any machine that has a copy
of the repository has all the information required to act as a remote, too.
It also means that every action regarding that repository can be executed
without having to consult with another system.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Creating another copy of a repository is called <em>cloning</em>. That&rsquo;s why we
use the command <code>git clone &lt;repository-url&gt;</code> to start working with code
from services like Github, Gitlab and others on our machines.</p>

<p>If you still have some time on your hands and are looking for some commands
to do some hands-on experimentation, I refer you to <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository">chapter 2</a>
of the aforementioned book Pro Git where you&rsquo;ll find just that.</p>
<p>But from my side, that&rsquo;s all for today - keep learning and see you tomorrow!</p>
