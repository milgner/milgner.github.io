&ldquo;Documentation is a love letter that you write to your future self.&rdquo;
&ndash; Damian Conway
Although there are many arguments being made to rationalize our laziness and
avoid writing proper documentation, there is no doubt in my mind that good
software documentation is a great tool to improve the development lifecycle
of long-running projects.
If you know your project is going to be scrapped in 2 months time, feel free
to stop reading here and enjoy a good book or a walk outside. &#x2600;&#xfe0f;
But if it&rsquo;s any more than that, you should make your live and the lives of
your co-workers easier by documenting your software. Even projects with a
originally limited lifetime have been known to live long past their best-
before date.">

<p>&ldquo;Documentation is a love letter that you write to your future self.&rdquo;

<p>Although there are many arguments being made to rationalize our laziness and
avoid writing proper documentation, there is no doubt in my mind that good
software documentation is a great tool to improve the development lifecycle
of long-running projects.</p>
<p>If you know your project is going to be scrapped in 2 months time, feel free
to stop reading here and enjoy a good book or a walk outside. &#x2600;&#xfe0f;
But if it&rsquo;s any more than that, you should make your live and the lives of
your co-workers easier by documenting your software. Even projects with a
originally limited lifetime have been known to live long past their best-
before date.</p>
<p>The question is, how to document them. As for the structure, I can recommend
<a href="https://arc42.org/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arc42</a>. But when it comes to implementation details, I
am surprised that many people are still using Wikis to keep their
documentation.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gitlab Handbook</a> has a great section
about how <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/handbook-usage/#wiki-handbooks-dont-scale"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wikis don&rsquo;t scale</a>
for handbooks and I have found that most of these arguments also apply when
it comes to software documentation.</p>
<p>The points being made are, essentially:</p>
<h3 id="1-there-is-no-review-process">
  1. There is no review process
  <a class="heading-link" href="#1-there-is-no-review-process">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h3>
<p>Most Wiki software, especially Confluence, which is highly established in the
software development business, doesn&rsquo;t have a proper review process. You can&rsquo;t
easily propose a change and check it for correctness or discuss it with your
colleagues: you need to make the change and the old page gets overridden.</p>
<h3 id="2-you-cant-change-or-roll-back-multiple-pages">
  2. You can&rsquo;t change or roll back multiple pages
  <a class="heading-link" href="#2-you-cant-change-or-roll-back-multiple-pages">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h3>
<p>When evolving your software, oftentimes your changes will relate to more than
one page of the documentation. In a Wiki you can only make changes on a page-
by-page basis and changing multiple pages or rolling back all changes in a
changeset is not possible</p>
<h3 id="3-documentation-changes-are-independent-of-your-software-development-cycle">
  3. Documentation changes are independent of your software development cycle
  <a class="heading-link" href="#3-documentation-changes-are-independent-of-your-software-development-cycle">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h3>
<p>Ideally you&rsquo;ll update the documentation at the same time as you&rsquo;re making
these changes. Some changes, like <a href="https://adr.github.io/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Architecture Decision Records</a>
might even precede any actual implementation. So ideally you&rsquo;d want to wait
with publishing these changes until your code has been reviewed and gone
through any potential improvement cycles. But you can&rsquo;t do that with a wiki,
so you&rsquo;ll either have to document something that isn&rsquo;t live yet or you risk
forgetting to document some aspect because you postpone it until after making
the change.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-use-instead">
  What to use instead?
  <a class="heading-link" href="#what-to-use-instead">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h2>
<p>Luckily, there are some alternatives. For one, there&rsquo;s the <a href="https://doctoolchain.github.io/docToolchain"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">docToolchain</a>
project which can output a number of formats from a <a href="https://asciidoctor.org/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Asciidoc</a>-
based source. But as I am under the impression that Asciidoc isn&rsquo;t very
widely adopted in a non-technical audience, I find that I prefer Markdown-
centric solutions - after all, you want to empower everyone on the team to
contribute to the documentation.</p>
<p>Another approach which I have grown fond of recently is the use of static
site generators for documentation and serving these generated sites via
Gitlab or Github pages.</p>
<p>Which static site generator you&rsquo;ll use will probably depend a lot on personal
preference. But there are pre-made themes for <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/tags/documentation/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hugo</a>,
<a href="https://gatsbyawesome.com/tag/documentation/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gatsby</a> and <a href="https://tdt-documentation.london.cloudapps.digital/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Middleman</a>.</p>
<p>They are usually very easy to set up for either <a href="https://gitlab.com/pages/gatsby/-/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gitlab</a>
and/or <a href="https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Github</a>.</p>
<p>And even for private projects, both Github and Gitlab allow configuring your
pages integration to only allow access for logged-in project members.</p>
