      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s talk about pet projects    In many years reviewing job applications from software developers, one topic has come up as surprisingly controversial time and again: pet projects, i.e. projects that developers work on on their own time. So let&amp;rsquo;s have a look and see what the fuzz is all about.
From the employers perspective    First, let&amp;rsquo;s look at it from the employers perspective. A colleague of mine once succinctly put it like this: &amp;ldquo;You wouldn&amp;rsquo;t expect a slater to tile a roof in their free time, would you?</description>

      <description>Value Objects in Rails    While writing yesterdays post about the usage of Hash vs class, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but think of another powerful tool that helps us to build a well-defined model of our problem domain in the programming language of our choice: the value object.
To understand the value of value objects (scnr), let&amp;rsquo;s take an example: 42. &amp;ldquo;What is 42?&amp;rdquo;, you might be tempted to ask - and rightfully so.</description>

      <description>Idiomatic Ruby: Hash vs class    It is no secret that I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of typed languages. To me, an expressive type system really helps to convey the mental model of the application to the developers maintaining the code base.
As such, I am often dismayed when reading code from untyped interpreted languages. Sure, there are classes in Javascript, Ruby and Python. But very often I find that they&amp;rsquo;re eschewed in favour of just bundling a list of attributes together in an untyped Object, Hash or Dict respectively.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s a short excerpt from my past and current (public) projects:
 SR6 Character Sheet: when our gaming group switched to online play during the COVID-19 pandemic, I built a digital character sheet for Shadowrun 6 Keedrop: easily &amp;amp; securely send passwords. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t replace GPG, but at least you won&amp;rsquo;t have to send them in plaintext over chat or email. k290-fnkeyctl: when I got myself annoyed with the way that my Logitech keyboard handled its function keys, I reverse-engineered a small application to switch the behaviour on Linux.</description>

      <title>Wikis aren&#39;t meant for software documentation</title>

      <description>Wikis aren&amp;rsquo;t meant for software documentation     &amp;ldquo;Documentation is a love letter that you write to your future self.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Damian Conway Although there are many arguments being made to rationalize our laziness and avoid writing proper documentation, there is no doubt in my mind that good software documentation is a great tool to improve the development lifecycle of long-running projects.
If you know your project is going to be scrapped in 2 months time, feel free to stop reading here and enjoy a good book or a walk outside.</description>

      <description>Deploy a Vert.x application with an embedded SPA    As a developer I have come to enjoy the versatility and power of the Vert.x platform. And although it contains many utilities for server-side rendering, called Vert.x Web, there are situations where you might want to use a single-page application (SPA) instead.
Concrete reasons for and against SPAs are best kept separate from this. One thing, however, that makes SPAs cumbersome for small teams is having to deploy them separately from the API they will talk to, so having a setup that allows for deploying everything in one go.</description>
